# Hotelfan
HackZÃ¼rich 2023 project

## Dataset
All data is provided in JSON format, with a supporting schema containing detailed field descriptions for data interpretation and manipulation. Data export contains all geographical and hotel data available to be booked on hotelplan.ch.$
In addition to the data supplied, external data sources such as Carbon Interface and AirVisual API are used.

## Goal
Our goal is that, with the help of a chatbot, we can help the user choose the most suitable and climate-friendly trip.

## Analyzing of user input
As planned we wanted to implement the analyzation of the user input with ChatGPT-4.
While developing we was confrontent with some challanges.
So we already prepared the information but didn't connect it to the frontend.
In a later time we would investigate and fix it so we can have an even better user experience.
